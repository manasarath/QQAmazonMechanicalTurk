For example: I always have to make sure when ""Victor's"" name is mentioned if it's Victor Kiriakis from DAYS or Victor Newman from Y & R which I don't watch. Isn't there also a ""Carly"" on GH as well as Days. I know some names like ""jack"" or ""Nick"" have been used multiple times but it's confusing. On Y & R there is or was a ""Chloe"" & even a ""Rafe"" like on DOOL & that's not a common name. Then there was a ""Rex"" on DOOL & now there's one on OLTL. Does any1 else ever get confused? If a ""Hope"" is ever introduced on another soap other than Days I will scream LOL!

(Read first? I'm in a very complicated yet amazing romance. I'm a 30 year lesbian and I'm in love with a married bisexual housewife named Lisa. I'm 30 and she's almost 42. She's been with her husband Sam since 1988. We all started off as friends(we met online) and we have occasional threesomes. Sam and I share nothing but friendship and lust. I'm fulfilling his wildest typical man's fantasy. But it's beyond that with Lisa. Lisa and I actually love each other.

P-Lisa, Sam, their 19-year old daughter Rachel and their 12 year old son Sammy all live together. Additionally, Rachel's boyfriend Kirk lives with them. Yesterday, Lisa told me that she might change her mind about moving to Connecticut because she doesn't want to make me sad. I told her that it doesn't matter how sad I'll be, I will NEVER be selfish enough to make her drop her plans for me. My love for her is strong enough to LET HER GO, does that make any sense to you? I will drop everything before I hurt Sam, their children and the marriage they had for so long. BUT, Lisa says another reason why she might not leave is because her daughter really loves her boyfriend and he's not 100% sure if he's going to Connecticut with them or not. So, she's not just thinking of my feelings, she's thinking of her daughter as well. But I'm confused, two days ago I witnessed Lisa arguing with Rachel about the moving situation and she says that she is not going to let Rachel's boyfriend be the deciding factor on whether they move or not. So, that's making me think that if she stays that it WILL be for me.

They're supposed to move to Connecticut in July; this is a decision they made before I met them.
P-Lisa, Sam, their 19-year old daughter Rachel and their 12 year old son Sammy all live together. Additionally, Rachel's boyfriend Kirk lives with them. Yesterday, Lisa told me that she might change her mind about moving to Connecticut because she doesn't want to make me sad. I told her that it doesn't matter how sad I'll be, I will NEVER be selfish enough to make her drop her plans for me. My love for her is strong enough to LET HER GO, does that make any sense to you? I will drop everything before I hurt Sam, their children and the marriage they had for so long. BUT, Lisa says another reason why she might not leave is because her daughter really loves her boyfriend and he's not 100% sure if he's going to Connecticut with them or not. So, she's not just thinking of my feelings, she's thinking of her daughter as well. But I'm confused, two days ago I witnessed Lisa arguing with Rachel about the moving situation and she says that she is not going to let Rachel's boyfriend be the deciding factor on whether they move or not. So, that's making me think that if she stays that it WILL be for me. On one hand, it makes me feel good, on the other hand I feel guilty. - I think the content is objective.","C-Will it be selfish to expect a MARRIED woman to drop her moving plans to continue her affair / me? (Read first? I'm in a very complicated yet amazing romance. I'm a 30 year lesbian and I'm in love with a married bisexual housewife named Lisa. I'm 30 and she's almost 42. She's been with her husband Sam since 1988. We all started off as friends(we met online) and we have occasional threesomes. Sam and I share nothing but friendship and lust. I'm fulfilling his wildest typical man's fantasy. But it's beyond that with Lisa. Lisa and I actually love each other. I've never slept with Sam without Lisa's presence but Lisa and I have had sex it without Sam plenty of times....everyday while Sam is working.
