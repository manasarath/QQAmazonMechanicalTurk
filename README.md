# QQAmazonMechanicalTurk
This project was created to measure the intercoder reliability (ICR) in way Amazon Mechanical Turk workers rate the quality of questions on different criterions.
-Too Broad (TB)
-Ambiguous (AM)
-General Statement (GS)
-Socially Awkward (SA)
-Poor Syntax (PS)
-Missing Information (MI)
-Redundancy (RE) 
-Garbled/Non-Formatted (NF)

This was the first step towards coming up with a framework to evaluate the quality of user-generated content. After the labels were recieved ICR were calculated and poor ICR values showed further work in revising the conceptual framework to evalluate UGC.
